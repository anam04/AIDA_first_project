# AIDA_first_project
Marketing Campaign Analysis

Objective
This project analyzes customer behavior using machine learning techniques to enhance marketing strategies. The key tasks include **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Clustering**, and **Classification**.

### Key Steps:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Summarize customer data (e.g., Income, Age, Spending Score).
   - Visualize data distributions, correlations, and patterns using histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices.
   - Generate actionable insights about customer behavior.

2. **Cluster Analysis:**
   - Use **K-Means Clustering** to group customers based on spending, income, and age.
   - Optimize clusters using the Elbow Method and interpret customer segments.

3. **Classification:**
   - Apply **Naive Bayes** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to predict customer purchase behavior.
   - Evaluate models using confusion matrices and compare performance.

   Deliverables:
- **Python Script**: Documented code for data analysis, clustering, and classification with visualizations (e.g., Elbow Plot, Cluster Scatter Plots).
- **PowerPoint Presentation**: Summarized findings for non-technical stakeholders, including business implications and actionable insights.

   Insights:
- Understand customer segments for targeted marketing.
- Predict purchase behavior to improve campaign outcomes.
